# Matrix-Calculator-Program-
Objective:
Solving problems based on matrix involves intensive calculation work and even a single mistake will be done, 
then user will not able to get the correct result. You have to enter elements for each row and column. Only entering 
data for each particular index, does not solve the problem. Getting output and processing tasks involved in getting the
desired result is much hard work. You to find the center value by eliminating the values of other indexes. While making
multiplication, you have to multiply each element with other element of second matrix. It processing work involves multiplying 
each row element of first matrix with every column element of other matrix. If you will solve this problem manually, then it will 
take some time and time also depends on the type of matrix. If the matrix size will be 2x2 then it can be solved easily, but if index
size will be greater than 3 or both matrix indexes will be differ, then itâ€™s hard to solve the problem within 5 minutes. So to save your
time, this system can be used to match your solutions just by entering few details about the type of matrix and about their elements.
Existing System:
Although the existing system also provide computer oriented solutions to get the matrix multiplications results but the existing 
system cannot be used for different sizes.It cannot be used for those matrix whose index sizes various and this system can only be 
used for those matrix whose index sizes are of two dimension. You will also be able to calculate multiplication of two matrices have 
dimension size 2x2. But you cannot able to get results on matrices having size greater then 2, so you will not able to check your result
at a time. The existing system also not able to display the entered elements while displaying the final results, so that user can verify
their entered data.
